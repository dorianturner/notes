Types of polymerisation from GCSE are condensation and addition polymerisation. 

### Addition polymers

Addition polymers are made from unsaturated (alkene) monomers (don't touch the ears) making a repeating chain. These are inert as bonds are strong and non polar, only attacked by free radicals.

### Condensation Polymers

You will be asked about 2 types of addition polymers. Polyesters and Polyamides, the names are pretty self explanatory but they are made from ester linkages and amide linkages respectively. Remember [[amides]] are R-C(=O)-NR'R''.

Side products are often small molecules like water and HCl.
