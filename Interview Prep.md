## Course Outline (Only noting down unique stuff)
### Y1
 - Functional Programming (in OCaml, heard good things about this)
 - Object Oriented Programming
 - Computer Graphics (Interesting, got interested by JDH and two minute papers)
 - Discrete maths (Interested in this, am teaching myself parts of the discrete maths A Level for fun)
 - Algorithms (Quite like algorithm questions on platforms like codeforces)
 - Machine Learning (want to look further at this beyond the level of 1950s perceptrons using sigmoid activation and step neurons, they should have used ReLu)
### Y2
 - Concurrent Systems (Monolith vs microservice?)
 - Group Project (Nice, I hope its fun)
 - Low level programming C and C++ (Game dev here I come, what is a pointer?)
 - Unix Tools (Use Linux already, arch btw, but don't really know about the special GNU tools)
 - Compilers (Don't really know much about this but seems interesting)
 - Cybersecurity (Interested by CyberFirst and Live overflow on YouTube, also like the Lecturer Frank Stajano from what I can see on YouTube)
### Y3
 - Julia Programming Language (Seems interesting for ML and scientific computing, ref Grant Sanderson aka 3Blue1Brown did some lectures for them)
 - More ML (Vision, NLP, Graphics all stuff from Yannic Kilcher Discord group)
 - Operating Systems (Seems interesting, see JDH os that only runs tetris)

## Personal Statement Analysis
### Statement Itself
```
I am fascinated by how I can use computer science to solve problems. I first became interested when I took a cybersecurity course for teenagers, run by the government. Here, I discovered that I really enjoyed learning about software. I see myself in five years either creating a tech startup, or honing my skills at an established tech company.

I fully started my tech journey with CanSat, a competition run by the European Space Agency to make a satellite and transmit data using telemetry. As the lead programmer, I explored embedded systems programming with the Raspberry Pi Pico to solve the challenge of using telemetry to send atmospheric data from a satellite to a ground station. To learn how to do this, I dug deep into online tutorials and taught myself how to use Python to analyse data, how to transmit it via radio signals, and then how to visualise that data, using a course from a data science community called ‘Kaggle’. This year, I am leading my school’s CanSat project where I am going to make easy-to-understand visualisations from climate data so that people can understand how their local environment is changing over time.

One area of computer science that grabbed me was how AI could generate images. For example, I learned about stable diffusion, a text-to-image model that creates photo-realistic images, and how it suffered from needing many iterations to produce a good result. I wondered if this could be improved, and read a paper on how to solve this issue by streamlining the process of going from noise-to-image by using a new technique called ‘rectified flow’. I am continuing to learn about how AI can work with images and have set up a robotics club to create an autonomous medieval siege engine that can identify and adjust its position in order to fire on and hit targets.

I see myself as more than just a scientist. Through debates at my school's ethics society, I have explored the intersection of technology and society. A recent project I put together is a mirror that only lets you see your reflection when you smile. The idea was to explore how people change the way they present themselves when given feedback. I achieved this by using a convolutional neural network that detected emotions and used a Raspberry Pi to control a PDLC film that can turn from opaque to transparent when current is passed through it. I then wanted to understand how models like these worked, so I watched an MIT lecture on convolutions in image processing, where I learned about image kernels and their use in feature extraction.

I also love maths and I am currently leading a team in an international maths competition called Ritangle, run by a maths education charity. I plan to use code to solve each problem. To do this, I am practising my mathematical programming on a website called ‘Project Euler’. As well as doing maths, I like to explore unique applications of maths by watching YouTube videos on more unusual topics such as ‘the mathematics of string art’.

Beyond my academic studies, I volunteered at a hospice where I got an appreciation for the importance of listening. I also volunteered at scouts where I learned to lead small teams and completed the Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award. I also love mountain biking, climbing, rugby and configuring my arch linux computer.

The landscape of computer science continues to evolve. I want the skills to seize any emerging opportunities. I see a computer science degree as a master key to unlocking the answer to these problems.

### Analysis
 - CyberFirst - Let me know about computer science and got me excited to use technology
 - CanSat - Proper Coding done here, got to learn about embedded systems and how to control varied hardware with a microcontroller to send data from long distances with telemetry. Had a bunch of data, but didn't really know what to do with it, so this year I am going to lead the team to try and collect even more data and most importantly, create really intuitive visualisations on it.
