#### primary amines

Primary amines act as [[Bronsted-Lowry]] bases the lone pair on the nitrogen readily accepts a proton in a [[covalent bond]]. 

CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> +H<sub>2</sub>O â‡Œ CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>+ +OH<sup>-</sup>

Straight chain amines are stronger bases than ammonia on its own as the [[alkyl groups]] pushes its negative charge towards the nitrogen atom . . . more readily available.

Note: Nitrogens like to form + plus one ions

#### secondary amines

Following logic of primary amines, secondary amines are stronger bases as they have more negative charged pushed onto the nitrogen from the alkyl groups.

#### tertiary amines

oddly enough, not stronger bases than secondary, we don't need to know why but is because they are less soluble in water

#### base (strong to weak): secondary amine > primary amine > aromatic amine

aromatic amines are weaker  bases as they have the negative charge on the nitrogen stolen by the delocalised electron ring in the benzene.

Amine + Acid --> ammonium salt

Because amines make weak bases, you can use them to make [[buffer solutions]] which, as a quick reminder, will be the base + the salt of the base

e.g. Ammonia and ammonium chloride, Methylamine and methylammonium chloride, Ethylamine and ethylammonium chloride

Make primary, secondary and tertiary amines by reaction of a halogenoalkane with ammonia. Will make primary where the lone pair on the N will react with another haloalkane . . . further substitution. Can mitigate by using excess of ammonia.

Mechanism: nucleophilic substitution, further reactions the same just with the N attatched to an [[alkyl groups]]

### Amines from 2 STEP REACTION

Note: Got this wrong in the test

Step 1: Start with a nitrile (easiest to use KCN) and then reflux with ethanol. CH3CH2Br + CN- --> CH3CH2CN + Br -

Step 2: reduce this new nitrile with Lithal or with H<sub>2</sub> and Nickel 
CH3CH2CN + 4[H]<sup>+</sup> --> CH3CH2CH2NH2

Why potentially bad? KCN toxic / low yield

Remember [[arenes]] / aromatics? You can reduce nitro groups on any aromatic amines with Sn and HCl. Its annoyingly specific, but you just need to know this. Alternatively just use hydrogen and nickel
