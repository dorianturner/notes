Not so important:
- aliphatic: straight  / branched chain organic substances
- aromatics / arenes: one or more six carbon atoms with delocalised bonding rings

Benzene (C6H6) - Each C atom is bonded to two other C atoms and one H atom by single covalent Ïƒ-bonds. This leaves one unused electron on each C atom in a p orbital, perpendicular to the plane of the ring. 

The six p electrons are delocalised in a ring structure above and below the plane of carbon atoms.

Note: You do need to able to draw this delocalisation ring of shared p orbitals

There are questions about thermodynamic stability / hess diagrams. Each double bond turning to a single is worth -120 kJ/mol. So a full benzene turning to a cyclohexane should be -360 kJ/mol right? No, it turns out that because of the delocalised electron structure in benzene, there is a difference between this theoretical value and the actual value. The actual value for turning benzene to cyclohexane is -208kJ/mol.

In general, for non benzene, it is -120kJ/mol for every double bond converted into a single bond in cyclohexane
