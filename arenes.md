Not so important:
- aliphatic: straight  / branched chain organic substances
- aromatics / arenes: one or more six carbon atoms with delocalised bonding rings

Benzene (C6H6) - Each C atom is bonded to two other C atoms and one H atom by single covalent Ïƒ-bonds. This leaves one unused electron on each C atom in a p orbital, perpendicular to the plane of the ring. 

The six p electrons are delocalised in a ring structure above and below the plane of carbon atoms.

Note: You do need to able to draw this delocalisation ring of shared p orbitals

There are questions about thermodynamic stability / hess diagrams. Each double bond turning to a single is worth -120 kJ/mol. So a full benzene turning to a cyclohexane should be -360 kJ/mol right? No, it turns out that because of the delocalised electron structure in benzene, there is a difference between this theoretical value and the actual value. The actual value for turning benzene to cyclohexane is -208kJ/mol.

In general, for non benzene, it is -120kJ/mol for every double bond converted into a single bond in cyclohexane

Nitrate benzene with conc nitric and conc sulfuric (catalyst). Electrophilic substitution.

Done at 60 C, can substitute more nitro groups if a higher temp used with this method

You can make an electrophile for reaction with benzene by reacting an acyl chloride with an anhydrous AlCl<sub>3</sub> catalyst. Heat under reflux.

Same mechanism, electrophillic substitution, remember the horseshoe.

Repeat from [[amines]] , can reduce a nitroarene to an amine with Sn and HCl or Ni and H<sub>2</sub>. Requires 6[H]

Not sure if this next bit really is important: For side groups with lone pairs such as Cl, OH or NH2, the delocalisation in the ring will extend to the lone pairs and strengthen the bond, making it harder for typical reactions like haloalkane elimination / substitution to occur.
